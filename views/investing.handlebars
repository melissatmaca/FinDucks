        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Investing might seem like a venture reserved for the financially savvy or those well into their careers, but it's a crucial skill for college students too. This chapter will introduce you to the basics of investing, highlight the importance of starting early, and guide you through initial steps to make your money work for you.</p>

        <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
        <p>Investing is more than just a way to make extra money; it's about securing your financial future. The earlier you start, the more you can take advantage of compound interest, where your earnings generate their own earnings. Think of it like planting a tree; the sooner you plant it, the longer it has to grow.</p>
        <p>Inflation is another reason to invest. Over time, the value of money decreases, meaning your dollar today will be worth less tomorrow. Investing can help your money grow at a rate that outpaces inflation, maintaining or increasing its value over time.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Investing</h2>
        <p>As a student, you might think you need a lot of money to start investing, but that's not true. You can start with small amounts and gradually build your portfolio. Here are some common investment options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Buying a stock means purchasing a small portion of a company. While stocks can offer high returns, they also come with higher risk due to market volatility.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Bonds are essentially loans you give to corporations or the government. They pay back the principal with interest on a fixed schedule. Bonds are generally considered safer than stocks but offer lower returns.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Funds and ETFs:</strong> These are collections of various stocks or bonds, allowing you to diversify your investments with a single purchase. They're managed by professionals and are a good option for beginners.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Risk and Return</h2>
        <p>Investing always involves some level of risk, but not all investments carry the same level of risk. Your risk tolerance – the degree of variability in investment returns that you can withstand – should guide your investment choices. As a student, you might be more risk-averse, preferring safer investments like bonds or ETFs. Balancing risk and return is key to a successful investment strategy.</p>

        <h2>Practical Tips for Student Investors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start Small: Begin with what you can afford. Many online platforms and apps allow you to start investing with small amounts. Regular, consistent investments, even small ones, can grow significantly over time.</li>
            <li>Research and Education: Before investing in anything, do your research. Understand what you're investing in, the risks involved, and the potential returns. Financial literacy is a journey – the more you learn, the better your investment decisions will be.</li>
            <li>Diversify: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your investments can reduce risk. This means spreading your investments across different types of assets, like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.</li>

        <h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h2>
        <p>Many new investors try to time the market, buying in when they think the market is low and selling when they think it's high. However, market timing is incredibly difficult, even for professionals. A better strategy is a long-term investment, where you remain invested through market ups and downs.</p>
        <p>Another common mistake is investing heavily in a single stock or sector. While it's tempting to go all-in on an investment that seems promising, diversification is safer and often more profitable in the long run.</p>
