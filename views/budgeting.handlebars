        <h2>What is a Budget?</h2>
        <h3>Definition and Purpose</h3>
        <p>A budget is a financial plan that estimates income and expenses over a certain period. It's a tool that helps you understand your money flow – what comes in and what goes out. The purpose of a budget is not just to track your spending, but also to help you make informed decisions about your money.</p>
        
        <h3>Budgeting Myths</h3>
        <p>Many people think that budgeting is about restricting yourself and cutting back on everything fun. However, that's a myth. Budgeting is about understanding your spending habits and making sure your money is used effectively towards your goals.</p>

        <h2>Why Budgeting is Essential</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Financial Awareness:</strong> Budgeting creates a clear picture of your spending habits. You might be surprised to find out how much you spend on non-essential items. This awareness is the first step towards financial control.</li>
            <li><strong>Control Over Finances:</strong> A budget puts you in the driver’s seat of your finances. It enables you to prioritize your spending, making sure that essential expenses are covered while still allocating funds for leisure and savings.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal Setting:</strong> Whether it’s saving for a new laptop, a spring break trip, or just building an emergency fund, budgeting helps you set and achieve these financial goals.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Creating Your First Budget</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Track Your Income and Expenses:</strong> Start by listing all sources of income. Then, track your expenses for a month. Categorize these expenses into essentials (like rent, groceries, tuition) and non-essentials (like eating out, subscriptions).</li>
            <li><strong>Setting Up Categories:</strong> Divide your expenses into categories. This not only helps in understanding where your money goes but also in identifying areas where you can cut back.</li>
            <li><strong>Balancing Your Budget:</strong> The goal is to ensure your income covers your expenses. If you’re spending more than you earn, look for areas to cut back. If you have extra money, decide how much you want to save or spend.</li>
        </ol>
